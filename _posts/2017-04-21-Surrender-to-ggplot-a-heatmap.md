Our office mate is a biologist, he is screening activity of various plants in a number of parasites with a hope to unlock some potential for drug discovery. Today he needed to produce a heatmap and asked us how to do it. I actively do not like ggplot because of the non-intuitive coding that it requires, but when it comes to the prettifying abilities, one has to surrender.
