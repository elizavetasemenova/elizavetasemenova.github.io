DOT is not only a punctuation mark, it is also a graph description language used by <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/Home.php">Graphviz</a> - an open source software for graph visualization. Graphviz is very helpful when one needs to display any object with connections, be they phisical or logical, such as networks and flowcharts.

Since I am currently going through simulation algorithms, it is really handy to have that diagram displaying relationships between 
various probability distributions in front of me. Here I can mark quickly which algorithms I have already implemented and which not. The
diagram was created with the <a href="http://rich-iannone.github.io/DiagrammeR/">DiagrammeR</a> package with the code presented below.
