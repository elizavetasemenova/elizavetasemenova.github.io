This world would be a better place if we invested more in developing cleaner software and smarter algorithms, not writing longer papers. The concept of clean software includes packaging several routines and functionalities together, making them easy to re-use. 

Now, beyond lyrics: I have put together a wrapper-script for myself, which creates an R-package from the raw source code in one line. As proof of concept, I used the code to create a package out of itself. It is called 'packageR' and you can also  install it from my GitHub repository:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/elizavetasemenova/eb330be06bb6df9fe83cbe456ca8df22.js"></script>

Now the help page should be displaying information about the <i>create_package</i> function and you are set for happy packaging!
