Last October together with [Alex](http://www.ics.uzh.ch/~alexs/) and [Maria](https://modelsbottles.wordpress.com/) we submitted our 
proposal for a workshop at Applied Machine Learning Days 2018 at EPFL. Surprise - it was accepted!! This means that on the 27th January
2018 we will give a full day workshop 
["Machine Learning for News: Theory, Applications and Visualisation in Python"](https://www.appliedmldays.org/workshop_sessions/machine-learning-for-news-theory-applications-and-visualisation-in-python)

Since the day when this information became public people are showering us with questions regarding prerequisites, an overall plan, content and whether the created material will be available for non-participants. As a response I have started a repo, where the material will be continuously updated up to the date of the workshop. The overall plan of the Deep Learning component is already there:

It is highly probable that I will be creating blog post out of separate parts of the material and link them here with no guarantee that the material will be presented at the workshop exactly in the form presented on a post.

Can't wait to see you in Lausanne in January!
