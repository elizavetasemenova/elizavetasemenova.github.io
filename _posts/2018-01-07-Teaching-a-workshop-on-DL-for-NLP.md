Last October together with [Alex](http://www.ics.uzh.ch/~alexs/) and [Maria](https://modelsbottles.wordpress.com/) we submitted our 
proposal for a workshop at Applied Machine Learning Days 2018 at EPFL. Surprise - it was accepted!! This means that on the 27th January
2018 we will give a full day workshop 
["Machine Learning for News: Theory, Applications and Visualisation in Python"](https://www.appliedmldays.org/workshop_sessions/machine-learning-for-news-theory-applications-and-visualisation-in-python)

Since the day when this information became public people are showering us with questions regarding prerequisites, an overall plan, content and whether the created material will be available for non-participants. As a response I have created a repository, where prior to the workshop I may post the overall plan and some teaser material and after the workshop a more extended version of the material. 

The overall plan of the Deep Learning component is already in the 

* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/elizavetasemenova/amld-2018).

For more posts on this topic from my-self and co-creators of the workshop follow these links:

* [Setting up virtual environments](https://elizavetasemenova.github.io/blog/2018/01/18/Setting-up-virtual-environment)

Can't wait to see you in Lausanne in January!
