	<h1>Hi there...</h1>
	<p>... I'm Liza, a PhD student in Biostatistics with background in theoretical mathematics, currently involved into 
		modeling of infectious diseases. Bayesian statistics, spatio-temporal clustering, predictive modeling, 
		understanding of transmission dynamics via deterministic and stochatic processes
		is by far not the complete list of topics that have come up since the beginning of the doctorate
		and made me wrap my mind around them. Not to forget are the effects of importation and networks on eradiction of
		infections diseases, as well as the power of DNA-sequencing and phylogenetics to discover the source of infection and
		compute the transmission rate which can shed more linght onto the ongoing transmission tha the same quantity 
		derived with purely epidemiological methods.
	</p>	
		
		
	<p>Anyhow, the main learning of the PhD program so far has been the understanding of the role of patience, 
		perseverence and resilience that it takes to stay on track. Not having accomplished a major project and published YET
		does not mean one has not done or learnt anything useful. On the contrary - each day is full of micro-discoveries,
		worh a micro-post of, maybe, several lines of code. Exactly for posts of such kind I have created this space. </p>
		
	 <p>Hope to start filling this page with some simple stats examples soon. But feel free to browse away already! </p>
