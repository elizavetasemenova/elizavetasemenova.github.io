	<h1>Hi there...</h1>
	<p>... Liza here, a statictician/epidemiologist in progress aiming to craft some statistics-flavoured simplicity on this site. 
		More formally, I am a PhD student in Biostatistics with background in mathematics, currently working on the 
		modeling of infectious diseases - how they spread and take over the world. 
	</p>	
	    
	<p>	Bayesian statistics, spatio-temporal clustering, predictive modeling, 
		understanding of transmission dynamics via deterministic and stochatic processes
		is by far not the complete list of topics that have come up since the beginning of the doctorate
		and made me wrap my mind around them. Not to forget are the effects of importation and networks on eradiction of
		infectious diseases, as well as the power of DNA-sequencing and phylogenetics to discover the source of infection and
		compute the transmission rate. This way more light can be shed on the ongoing transmission than by the same quantity 
		derived with purely epidemiological methods...
	</p>	
		
		
	<p>Anyhow, the main learning of the PhD program so far has been the understanding of the role of patience, 
		perseverence and resilience that it takes to stay on track. Not having accomplished a major project and published YET
		does not mean one has not done or learnt anything useful. On the contrary - each day is full of micro-discoveries,
		worh if not a paper, but a micro-post in your blog even if it consist of several lines of code or one formula. Exactly
		for posts of such kind this space has been created.
        	
    <p>At the very beginning of my PhD I asked a more senior colleague how did he learn the craft. With all respect to that person,
	       his answer was as coincise as useless
		- 'learning by doing'. Looking back I wish I had more guidance on good and bad practices. Learning by doing 
		certainly works to find A solultion, but not necessarily a good solution. Learning the hard way leads to a great loss
		of time which can be otherwise spent on creative ideas instead of solving technical issues. It is not wise neither from 
	        individual nor communal point of view.
		
		
        <p>Having said that, the concept of this site is straightforward - getting simple and neat examples from statistics
		and related computational strategies posted; creating standardizes workflows for the use of my epidemiology/biology
		friends sometimes stopping by to chat about their analysis objectives; mentioning of interesting papers and events.
	        In a word, this is my PhD-period sketchbook.</p>
	
	 <p>Hope to start filling this page with more content soon. Feel free to browse away, there are already couple of posts awaiting
		 in the <a href="/blog">Blog</a>! </p>
