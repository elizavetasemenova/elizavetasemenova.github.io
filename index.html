	<h1>Hi there...</h1>
	<p>... I'm Liza, a PhD student in Biostatistics with background in theoretical mathematics, currently involved into 
		modeling of infectious diseases. Bayesian statistics, spatio-temporal clustering, predictive modeling, 
		understanding of transmission dynamics via deterministic and stochatic processes
		is by far not the complete list of topics that have come up since the beginning of the doctorate
		and made me wrap my mind around them. Not to forget are the effects of importation and networks on eradiction of
		infections diseases, as well as the power of DNA-sequencing and phylogenetics to discover the source of infection and
		compute the transmission rate which can shed more light on the ongoing transmission than the same quantity 
		derived with purely epidemiological methods...
	</p>	
		
		
	<p>Anyhow, the main learning of the PhD program so far has been the understanding of the role of patience, 
		perseverence and resilience that it takes to stay on track. Not having accomplished a major project and published YET
		does not mean one has not done or learnt anything useful. On the contrary - each day is full of micro-discoveries,
		worh if not a paper, but a micro-post in y	
        <p>Having said that, the idea behind this site is straightforward - getting simple and neat examples from statistics and/or related      
		computational strategies posted; creating reusable workflows that are useful for my epidemiology and biology firends,
		coming sometimes to chat about their analysis problems.</p>		
		
    <p>At the very beginning of my PhD I asked a senior colleague how did he learn the craft. His answer was as coincise as useless
		- 'learning by doing'. Looking back I wish I had more guidance on good and bad practices. Learning by doing 
		certainly works to find A solultion, but not necessarily a good solution. Learning the hard way leads to a great loss
		of time which can be otherwise spent on creative ideas instead of solving technical issues. It is not wise from
		communal point of view.
		
		
        <p>Having said that, the idea behind this site is straightforward - getting simple and neat examples from statistics/epidemiology/
		biology and related computational satrtegies posted; creating reusable workflows for the use of my epidemiology/biology
		friends sometimes coming to chat about their analysis problems.</p>
	
	 <p>Hope to start filling this page with some simple stats examples soon. But feel free to browse away already! </p>
