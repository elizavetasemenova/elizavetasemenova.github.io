  <h1>About this website</h1>
  <p>The idea behind this website is straightforward - getting simple and neat examples from statistics and/or related 
     computational strategies posted. Thinking of all statisticians as a community, I believe, our collective intelligence 
     would develop faster if we shared successful chunks of code not only on the level of packages but even on much lower scales
     more often and in a more open manner.
